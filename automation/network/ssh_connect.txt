Pexpect has a subclass called pxssh, which specializes in setting up SSH connections. The class
adds methods for login, logout, and various tricky things to handle the different situations in
the ssh login process.

Paramiko is a Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol. Just like the pxssh subclass of Pex-
pect, Paramiko simplifies the SSHv2 interaction between the host and the remote device. Unlike
pxssh, Paramiko focuses only on SSHv2 with no Telnet support. It also provides both client and
server operations.

``` ssh-keygen -t rsa ```
